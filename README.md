# Semantic HTML

## Site Recode

I had worked with two other classmates to recode a website to make it more efficent.

- my motivation was to make a better website.
- because the code was missing some semantic tags and some links were not working as intended.
- I made the search engine optimzation, jump to the correct place on the website when it's clicked on.
- the diffrent types of semantic tags and now to make the page jump to a diffrent place.

## Usage

clicking either the "search engine optimization", "online reputation management", or "social media marketing" will jump the user to the according info below. This allows user to get to the info that they want in a matter of a click. In my fixes, the search engine optimization wasn't working, so I have it an Id, which allowed it to jump to the right place.
